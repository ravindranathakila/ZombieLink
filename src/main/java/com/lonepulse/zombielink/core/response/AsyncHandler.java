TODO Async Handler Implementation (NOTES BELOW)

Let them build async handlers by annotating their classes, then link them to the endpoint ""interface"" via another annotation

@AsyncHandler, @OnSuccess, @OnFailure

Or just letting them implement this on the spot is easier right?

Or @OnSuccess on any method, then @AsyncHandler(onSuccess = "processPerson")

@OnSuccess(binding = myCCEndpoint.getUserProfile())
processPerson(HttpRequest httpRequest, Person person)

@OnSuccess
processPerson(HttpRequest httpRequest)

@OnSuccess
processPerson(Person person)
